Differences between 1.4 and 1.5
===============================

Test results can now have attachments.  They work exactly the same way
as the attachements that were already available for test runs.  For
example:

.. literalinclude:: ../../linaro_dashboard_bundle/test_documents/example_1.5_test_result_attachment.json
    :language: javascript
    :linenos:

.. _difference_between_1_3_and_1_4:

Differences between 1.3 and 1.4
===============================

Only one property was added. A test run object can now encode the precise
duration of the whole test. For example:

.. literalinclude:: ../../linaro_dashboard_bundle/test_documents/example_1.4_test_duration.json
    :language: javascript
    :linenos:
